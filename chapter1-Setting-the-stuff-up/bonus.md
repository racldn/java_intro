Delve a little deeper, do some research, and find out what do the following mean:

`public` - "public classes are classes which can be accessed by any other class"
`class` - "objects in java are called classes"
`static` - means that you can run this method without creating an instance of the main class
`void` - this means the method does not return a value
`main` - this is the name of the main method
`System` - this is a pre defined class provided by Java which holds useful methods and variables.
`out` - this is a static variable within System which represents the output of your program.
`println` - this is a method of 'out' which can print out a line.
